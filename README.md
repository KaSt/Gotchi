# Gotchi - Educational WiFi Security Research Platform

![Gotchi on M5Stack Cardputer](palnagotchi.jpg)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This project is intended for personal education and private network security research only.** It is designed to help users understand WiFi security mechanisms, network protocols, and embedded systems programming. Only use this software on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

## 📖 Overview

Gotchi is an educational WiFi security research platform that runs on M5Stack devices. The project evolved from a fork of [Palnagotchi](https://github.com/viniciusbo/m5-palnagotchi), initially created to provide companionship to Pwnagotchis through the Pwngrid friend protocol. Over time, it has grown to replicate several Pwnagotchi features and now includes its own lightweight "AI" decision-making system.

### Project Evolution

1. **Phase 1: Palnagotchi Fork** - Started as a friendly companion that could be detected by Pwnagotchis via Pwngrid beacons
2. **Phase 2: Feature Replication** - Implemented WPA handshake capture, PMKID detection, and packet analysis
3. **Phase 3: AI Implementation** - Added a Q-Learning based decision engine for autonomous channel hopping and network analysis

## 🧠 The "AI" System

The term "AI" might be grandiose for what is essentially a **Q-Learning reinforcement learning agent**, but it's far more appropriate than running full ML models on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero. Our implementation is specifically designed for embedded systems with limited RAM and CPU.

### How It Works

The AI uses **Q-Learning** (a reinforcement learning algorithm) to make decisions about:
- Which WiFi channel to monitor
- When to perform deauthentication attacks
- How long to observe each channel
- When to stay idle to save power

**State Space (312 possible states):**
- **Channel** (13 options): WiFi channels 1-13
- **AP Density** (3 levels): Empty, Low (1-2 APs), High (3+ APs)
- **Recent Success** (2 states): Captured handshake/PMKID recently or not
- **Time of Day** (4 buckets): Night, Morning, Afternoon, Evening

**Action Space (5 actions):**
- `STAY`: Continue monitoring current channel
- `NEXT`: Move to next channel
- `PREV`: Move to previous channel
- `DEAUTH`: Send deauthentication frames to trigger handshake
- `IDLE`: Enter low-power observation mode

**Learning Process:**
The agent receives rewards for:
- ✅ **+10** for capturing WPA handshakes
- ✅ **+8** for detecting PMKIDs
- ✅ **+1** for discovering new access points
- ❌ **-0.1** per timestep (encourages efficiency)

Over time (epochs), the agent learns which actions work best in different scenarios. The Q-table (knowledge matrix) is persisted to NVS flash memory, so learning continues across reboots.

**Hyperparameters:**
- Learning rate (α): 0.15
- Discount factor (γ): 0.90
- Exploration rate (ε): 0.40 → 0.05 (decays over time)
- Epoch tracking: Stored in EEPROM

### Why Not "Real" AI?

Traditional deep learning models require:
- Large memory footprint (100s of MB)
- Floating-point GPU acceleration
- Continuous training data pipelines
- High power consumption

Q-Learning provides:
- Tiny memory footprint (~15KB for Q-table)
- Runs efficiently on ESP32 @ 240MHz
- Simple state-action mapping
- Battery-friendly operation

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Pwngrid Protocol

Gotchi implements the Pwngrid advertisement protocol by:
1. Crafting custom WiFi beacon frames
2. Embedding JSON payload in vendor-specific information elements (IEs)
3. Broadcasting on channel 1 periodically
4. Listening for beacons from other devices
5. Parsing JSON to extract friend information

**Beacon Payload Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "YourGotchi",
  "identity": "abc123...",
  "pwnd_run": 0,
  "pwnd_tot": 175,
  "uptime": 2592,
  "epoch": 1,
  "face": "(^_^)",
  "policy": {
    "advertise": true,
    "bond_encounters_factor": 20000,
    "bored_num_epochs": 0,
    "channels": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],
    "excited_num_epochs": 9999,
    "min_recon_time": 5,
    "min_rssi": -200,
    "personality": "Friendly",
    "sad_num_epochs": 0
  }
}
```

### Q-Learning Implementation

The AI maintains a Q-table: `Q[state][action] → expected reward`

**Update Rule:**
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ·max(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)]
```

Where:
- `s`: Current state
- `a`: Action taken
- `r`: Reward received
- `s'`: Next state
- `α`: Learning rate
- `γ`: Discount factor

**Exploration vs Exploitation:**
- ε-greedy strategy: Random action with probability ε, otherwise best action
- ε decays from 0.40 to 0.05 over ~1000 epochs
- Prevents getting stuck in local optima

### Data Persistence

**EEPROM Storage:**
- Friend totals (8 bytes)
- Handshake totals (8 bytes)
- AI epoch counter (4 bytes)
- Configuration magic byte (1 byte)

**NVS Flash Storage:**
- Q-table matrix (15KB)
- AI hyperparameters
- Storage preferences
- Device configuration

**File Storage (LittleFS/SD):**
- `/friends.ndjson`: Friend database with GPS coordinates
- `/packets.ndjson`: Captured packet metadata
